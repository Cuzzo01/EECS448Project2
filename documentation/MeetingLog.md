# Meeting Log

Again, we primarily communicated using a Discord server. This time we only had
one formal meeting. Since Discord is chat based, there are no specific times for
when Discord "meetings" occurred. In our Discord we also setup a
channel to alert all team members when someone commits to the Github repo.

Spahr Library (Mar 3, 2019) 7pm to 9pm:
* Code review/learning about the code base we were given
* Decided on the special feature and how to implement it
* Delegated roles/tasks (special feature, cheat mode, cleaning up inherited code)
