# Features not added

Given more time, we could have spiced up the program significantly. We most certainly could have optimized the program even more than we did, as runaway mode can get a little slow with large board sizes.

We also could have styled the page in a more user friendly way. We decided to make our changes consistent with the style that was already in place, but we could have organized the buttons in a more readable way, or improved the notifications to make them more smooth and consistent.

One thing that would have been a nice touch would be pictures or animations associated with the tiles. For example we could have used pictures of mines and flags instead of simply editing the shape of the tile. Adding animations would have been a nice touch, but our priorities lied elsewhere.
