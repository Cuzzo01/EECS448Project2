# What We Would Have Done Differently

In retrospect, we probably could have used more of the original code base in the final product. It would have made this project get done much faster if we did not make as many changes as we did.


Although by doing what we did, the code in general was much more object oriented and readable. This also optimized some cases with recursion that were slowing the game down unnecessarily. It was also required if we wanted to implement the additional feature we originally came up with.
