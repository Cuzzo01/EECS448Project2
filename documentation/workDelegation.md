# Work Delegation

**Nick**

  Nick was tasked with creating cheat mode, which meant showing the user where the bombs were, allowing them to win easily. Furthermore, he also had to ensure that the board had a maximum possible size, so as to ensure that the user could not crash the program by inputting ludicrous board sizes.

  **Ian**

  Ian was incredibly helpful in making the code more readable. He analyzed the entire program and painstakingly cleared up a lot of the code that was difficult to follow, and made it much more usable. He was also tasked with allowing the user to win without flagging any bombs by uncovering all of the non-mine tiles.

  **Cameron**

  Cameron had to separate the rows and columns variables, to allow the user to create a rectangular board, as the inherited codebase allowed only for a square board. Furthermore, the program initially did not allow the user to place more flags than there were mines on the board, and he had to edit the program to allow the user to place as many flags as they desired.

  **Grady**

  Grady had a significant contribution to the project, as he implemented a redesigned version of the project using each tile as its own html element, which made the code far easier to work with, which made adding functionality much simpler. He also was the inspiration and author of the additional feature, Runaway Mode. This was a rendition of cheat mode in which the mines move away from the users' cursor.
