# Challenges

* Previous code base was not suitable for adding the additional feature we wanted to add

  In order the implement the run away mode the original implementation using the P5 library and canvasses was not suitable. We needed to be able to individualize the clickable buttons and this required each of them to be their own HTML element. To fix this, we rewrote how the board was made and displayed to use a grid-layout with HTML elements.

* All other work had to wait until the HTML element design had been implemented.

  The majority of the other work relied on making edits to the board and this had to wait until the redesign was completed before any real work could be started. This issue was resolved by quickly completing a base rework and working off of this until a finalized version was done.
